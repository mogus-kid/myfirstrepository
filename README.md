# My First Repository

"Hello World" in about 10+ Programming Languages. This is just an introduction for me to GitHub :D


Currently includes languages: Python, C, C++, Rachet (@Bean_Pringle's language), Java, Rust, and HTML!

Languages to be added later: JavaScript, and C#.


I am trying to learn the basics of various programming languages, such as variables and printing text.

<h3>Formatting</h3>

The formatting of each of the files will go like this, using Python's Hello World as an example:

```
hello = "Hello Python World!"
print(hello)
```

The code needs to have a variable (if possible) set to the string "Hello [Language] World!" and needs to print that variable.

I will use W3Schools to learn each of these languages, and maybe some other sources.


This is just a fun little project for me to do when I have some free time, and also to explore other programming languages.

There are also compiled versions runnable with an .exe file.


Also, for the Rachet language, it uses an extension in VSCode :D.
